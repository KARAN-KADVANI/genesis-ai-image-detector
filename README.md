# AI vs REAL : AI  GENERATED IMAGE DETECTOR

An advanced image classification system designed to distinguish between **AI-generated** (synthetic) images and **Real** (camera-captured) photographs. 
Built using transfer learning with a fine-tuned **EfficientNet-B0** architecture.

## 🧐 THE PROBLEM
As AI image generators (DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion) become more realistic, it is increasingly difficult to verify the authenticity of visual media.
This project aims to provide a reliable tool for researchers, journalists, and everyday users to identify synthetic artifacts that are invisible to the human eye.

## 🏗️ TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE
- **Base Model:** `timm.efficientnet_b0` (Pre-trained on ImageNet)
- **Framework:** PyTorch
- **Optimization:** Adam Optimizer with Cross-Entropy Loss
- **Input Size:** 224x224 RGB
- **Deployment:** Streamlit Community Cloud

## 🛠️ The Development Journey

## 🧪 First Attempt — Simple Beginning

### Model
- ResNet-18 (pretrained on ImageNet)

### Dataset
- Kaggle AI-generated image dataset
- COCO mini-train dataset (real images)

### Outcome
- Good validation performance
- Failed on **highly realistic AI images**, especially human faces

### Learning
> Simple datasets lead to models that learn superficial patterns.

---

## 🔄 Second Attempt — Architecture Upgrade

### Model
- EfficientNet-B0

### Dataset
- Kaggle mixed-generator AI dataset  
  (diffusion + GAN + other generators)
- Real image datasets

### Additional Experiment
- Frequency-domain features (FFT)

### Outcome
- Slight improvement
- Accuracy still unstable
- Generalization problem remained

### Learning
> Architecture alone cannot fix dataset bias.

## 🧠 Final Strategy — Phase-wise Curriculum Learning

Instead of training on all data at once, we trained the model **in phases**, gradually increasing dataset difficulty.

---

## 📍 Phase 1 — Basic Learning

### Goal
Learn obvious AI vs Real differences.

### Dataset
- Kaggle AI dataset
- Kaggle mixed-generator dataset
- COCO mini-train + Kaggle real images

### Training
- EfficientNet-B0 backbone fully frozen
- Only classifier trained

### Result
- Learned basic patterns
- Failed on **realistic human AI images**

---

## 📍 Phase 2 — Human Realism

### Goal
Handle hyper-realistic human AI images.

### Dataset Added
- Kaggle realistic human AI dataset
- Manually generated SDXL human images
- DiffusionDB human samples


### AI Image Generation
- Model: Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL)
- Type: Latent diffusion text-to-image model
- Usage: Inference only
- Library: HuggingFace diffusers

### Training
- Partially unfroze backbone (last blocks)
- Lower learning rate

### Result
- Human realism issue solved
- Failed on **non-human realistic AI images**

---

## 📍 Phase 3 — Non-Human Realism

### Goal
Detect realistic AI images without humans.

### Dataset Added
- Manually generated SDXL images:
  - Nature
  - Animals
  - Interiors
  - Architecture
  - Objects
- DiffusionDB non-human images

*(Human images were initially excluded to avoid overfitting.)*

### Result
- Good generalization across most categories
- Minor failures on artistic / painterly AI images

---

## ⚠ Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|--------|----------|
Overfitting to simple AI | Added realistic SDXL data |
Human realism failure | Phase 2 training |
Non-human realism failure | Phase 3 training |
Architecture limitation | EfficientNet-B0 |
Dataset leakage | Strict data splitting |



---

## 🏁 Conclusion

This project shows that **dataset quality and training strategy matter more than model complexity**. Phase-wise training enabled the model to generalize to highly realistic AI images.

Future work includes improving robustness on artistic and stylized AI generations.
